# Meter

Meters are used to represent scalar values within a known range.

```html
<forge-meter id="meter">
  <label for="meter">Label</label>
</forge-meter>
```

## Tickmarks

Meters can be configured to display tickmarks at regular intervals along the track. The `tickmarks` property toggles whether or not tickmarks are present and the number of tickmarks is set via the `--forge-meter-tickmarks` token.

```html
<forge-meter id="meter" tickmarks style="--forge-meter-tickmarks: 9;">
  <label for="meter">Label</label>
</forge-meter>
```

## Segmented

Setting a meter's `low` or `high` value turns it into a segmented meter. A segmented meter is divided into three regions â€” below the low value, above the high value, and between the two. Its color changes based on the value of the meter in relation to its `optimum` property. When the value is in the same region as the optimum, the value is optimal and colored green. When it's in an adjacent region it's suboptimal and colored yellow. Otherwise, it's least optimal and colored red.

When set, `low` must be greater than or equal to `min` and less than `high`. Likewise, `high` must be less than or equal to `max` and greater than `low`.

```html
<forge-meter id="meter" low="0.33" high="0.67" optimum="1">
  <label for="meter">Label</label>
</forge-meter>
```

## Grouped

Multiple related meters representing parts of a whole can be grouped together to display on the same track. Each meter in the group must have the same min and max values, which are managed by the `<forge-meter-group>` element, and can't be segmented.

Grouped meters are typically accompanied by keys that label each meter with its color and optionally its value. Each key can be semantically associated with its meter by using a `<label>` element with a `for` attribute that matches the meter's `id`.

```html
<forge-meter-group id="meter-group">
  <label slot="label" for="meter-group">Label</label>
  <forge-meter
    id="meter-1"
    value="0.25"
    style="--forge-meter-color: #1E88E5;"
  ></forge-meter>
  <forge-meter
    id="meter-2"
    value="0.15"
    style="--forge-meter-color: #FDD835;"
  ></forge-meter>
  <forge-meter
    id="meter-3"
    value="0.35"
    style="--forge-meter-color: #43A047;"
  ></forge-meter>
</forge-meter-group>

<forge-key style="margin-block-start: 8px;">
  <forge-key-item style="--forge-key-item-icon-color: #1E88E5;">
    <label for="meter-1">First</label>
    <span slot="value">25%</span>
  </forge-key-item>
  <forge-key-item style="--forge-key-item-icon-color: #FDD835;">
    <label for="meter-2">Second</label>
    <span slot="value">15%</span>
  </forge-key-item>
  <forge-key-item style="--forge-key-item-icon-color: #43A047;">
    <label for="meter-3">Third</label>
    <span slot="value">35%</span>
  </forge-key-item>
</forge-key>
```

## Accessibility

Meters must always be labeled. This can be achieved through association with a `<label>` element or by setting the `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` attribute. Text within the label slot is not accessible on its own and must be explicitly linked to the meter if used as the label.

When using grouped meters make sure to also include a key that includes the name, color, and optionally value of each meter.

The meter automatically applies ARIA attributes reflecting its value, min, and max values. If the value shouldn't be expressed as a percentage (for example, if you are measuring discrete values or textual quantifiers like "low", "medium", and "high"), the `aria-valuetext` attribute should be set to a string representing how the meter should be read.

## Meter vs. Linear Progress

Though superficially similar, meters and linear progress indicators have different use cases. The linear progress component is used to indicate the state of an application â€” whether or not it is currently busy with a task â€” and its design reinforces this association. Meters, on the other hand, represent a relatively static data point within a known range. They may be used to represent the progress of a longer term task in certain situations, but usually not something that a user would expect to change while using your app. It may make sense to add `role="progressbar"` to a meter if that helps clarify its purpose for users of assistive technology.
